## Overview

A relatively small application that allows users to search through, filter, and view details about countries fetched from the REST Countries API. I worked on it on and off over the course of about a month. The "REST Countries API with color theme switcher" challenge was a great opportunity to showcase my Front end skills using React, Context API, Axios, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The app is responsive, but was designed primarily for small mobile screens (width 375px) and desktops (width 1440px). 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
